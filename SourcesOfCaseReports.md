The case reports on rare diseases can be used for testing purposes in the project.

**Two online journals with open access to their articles**:
  * Case Reports on **_Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases_** http://www.ojrd.com/
    * example describing two patients with a rare muscle disease. http://www.ojrd.com/content/5/1/35
    * <font color='red'>on Jan 15, retrieved as PDFs: 20 rare disease case reports and 2 rare disease case studies</font>
      * <font color='red'>from the 22 retrieved cases, 20 articles were considered suitable for extracting rare disease queries</font>
      * two reports were excluded because: one presented symptoms of multiple patients together, and the other presented the usage of a drug in an atypical presentation of a common disease
    * on Feb 9, retrieved one more case report

  * Case Reports from **_Journal of Medical Case Reports_**, with search for rare diseases http://jmedicalcasereports.com/
    * <font color='red'>on Jan 15, retrieved as PDFs: 49 case reports referring to rare diseases</font>
    * on Feb 8, [51 results](http://goo.gl/Lf9kF) were returned

**Search engines**:
  * Search for case reports of rare diseases on **PubMed**
    * <font color='red'>over 1000 results, but only title and abstract can be collected for most of the results</font>

  * Search on **Google** over "rare disease case report" and maybe for the references from the already collected reports

**Other possible sources**:
  * **_DYSCERNE - Dysmorphology Diagnostic System_**  (http://www.dyscerne.org/dysc/DDS)
    * patient case reports submitted in the system
