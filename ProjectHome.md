The RareDisSS Project (Rare Dis<sub>eases</sub> <sub>decision</sub> S<sub>upport</sub> S<sub>ystem</sub>) is an attempt at developing a search engine specialized on providing results related to rare diseases. The search engine is to be used by the physician when suspecting a rare disease diagnosis for his patient. The results will be based on articles and case reports published in medical journals, reports collected and maintained by rare disease organizations, as well as web-based medical reference resources. [Read our wiki](RareDisSSProjectWiki.md) for more details.
